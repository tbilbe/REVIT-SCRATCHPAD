# Revit Cheat sheet :100:

Use this sheet to get up and running with creating python scripts in revit.

## Set up and Configuration of the Revit Python Shell (RPS) :snake:

Download link: <https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/revitpythonshell> 

Once downloaded the Revit Python Shell will be available on the Add-Ins tab

You can jump right into using the RPS but configuring the shell so its easier to use the REPL will give us some nice functionality.
We get the ability to select elements in the project and then go straight to the RPS and test scripts against the Revit Element.

### Configure the shell for use in the active model

Edit the Init script so that you have access to 2 key variables:
[The init script is here](COPY_init.py)

#### Inside the REPL
```python
el = 'gives us a list object of the selection so to interact further with the element use bracket notation el[0]'
s0 = 'gives us the first element in the list so jumps a step on the el variable'

# From here you can access methods on the specific elements, for example
categoryName = s0.Category.Name
# Note the lookup parameter takes a string which matches the name of the parameter in the project properties window
elevation = s0.LookupParameter('Elevation').AsValueString()
```

## Selectors and Collectors
Programmatically we can interact with any element within the live Revit model (we can interact with the linked model also, but thatâ€™s a little more advanced). We have to use `FilteredElementCollector()` to store the elements in a list object. Building a collector is a simple process, and it will become muscle memory!

Heres where the Revit API docs come in! <http://www.revitapidocs.com/>

The documentation will give an indication of how to interact with the elements in the model and it will become your best friend :couple_with_heart:

##### Scenario: Can you get me all the electrical equipment in the model? - Yes with a `FilteredElementCollector()`

looking into the docs , searching for FilteredElementCollector class will yeild ->  
**_This class is used to search, filter and iterate through a set of elements_**  
+ `FilteredElementCollector(doc)` requires a doc parameter which is the reference to the open project. (we've got this because of the init script edit)
+ `.OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_ElectricalEquipment)` inside the docs we can see this method is available to us. It also takes a parameter, a `BuiltInCategory`(a list of these can be seen below!
+ `WhereElementIsNotElementType()` self explanatory here, we dont want types we want the instances.
+ `ToElements()` Returns the complete set of elements that pass the filter(s).

There you have your first collector :metal:

### BuiltInCategory.OST_
I have collated a few categories, but the page has about 1000 to search, just use `Ctrl + f` on [the Revit API docs page](http://www.revitapidocs.com/2018.1/ba1c5b30-242f-5fdc-8ea9-ec3b61e6e722.htm) try and find some more to experiment with.
